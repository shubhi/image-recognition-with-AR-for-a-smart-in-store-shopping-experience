# Image-Recognition-with-AR-for-a-Smart-In-Store-Shopping-Experince-
The project aims to present a design to streamline the retail industry and enhance the in-store shopping experience. With the help of feature tracking, product packaging can be tracked as multi-image targets. Customers can scan a product from a hand-held device and obtain salient features specific to the product that will assist the customer in their decisions. This involves product attributes presented with a visual aid such as 3D models, regarding the brand, reviews, dietary information, prices, discounts, alternatives, etc. The complete application will be deployed on an android device, focusing to support an inventory for the store. With the help of cloud technology, the application can be improved to maintain dynamic metadata for the products.
 The project was delivered under the guidance of Dr. B. Amrutha (Head Of Department CSE)

## Objective: To design an application that can improve the user experience for in-store shopping using augmented reality and computer vision capabilities.

An E2E solution to achieve the following:
1. How to make in-store shopping more self-sufficient in pandemic-related situations?
2. How to make shopping a more comfortable experience for reticent and aged customers?
3. How to improve the general user experience in retail by digitization?
4. How to increase the assimilation of product details/features via Visualization of product details for users when viewing products (they are not familiar with them)?

## Building and Augmented Reality App

Available development / deployment platforms:
1. Unity Engine
2. Unreal Engine
3. Spark AR
4. Lens Studio

Available development softwares:
1. ARKit
2. ARCore
3. Vuforia

###                                       FINAL SOLUTION = VUFORIA SDK + UNITY ENGINE + ANDROID STUDIO

## Vuforia Studio: Open-Source web based tool to manage targets which can be created at run time and managed from the Vuforia Image Target Library repository which requires a free license.

  Natural Feature Tracking - Markerless tracking mechanism best suited for AR applications because
  * Only one image required to record features.
  * The entire image is not required to be present in the camera view.
  * Placement of Text, Audio, Video and 3D models on the surface of the virtual object.

  Advantages of target library - easy management/modification of the image targets which benefits constant modification in products.

## Market Study

  

## Results and Conclusion

1. Feature tracking with image recognition to register products as multiple image targets. Customers can scan products from handheld devices to obtain product-specific information.

2. Visual and Auditory overlay such as 3D models, images, videos, text,  regarding the brand, reviews, dietary information, prices, discounts, alternatives, advertisements, etc.

3. Cloud to support the maintenance of dynamic product metadata, which can be efficiently modified to the branding needs and accessed remotely.
